# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Kaggle

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Steps to execute:

1. First, Run a jupyter notebook server ($ jupyter notebook).
2. Open the Preprocessing & visualizations.ipynb file and run all the lines. (This will generate 2 csv files preprocessed_train_data.csv & preprocessed_test_data.csv)
3. Open the classifier you wish to try and run all the lines in that file. (This will generate a gender_submission.csv file)
4. Upload the file on kaggle to check the accuracy of that model.

Important Note:
The accuracy may vary since the code uses GridSearch.
